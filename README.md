# GBS-entanglement
Entanglement of photonic states in Gaussian Boson Sampling. Different liear optical network configurations are investigated to study the impact on the entanglement scaling of the output photon state.

S_profile.py computes a profile using parallel threading to average over different random U from LON 
Command-line input N: number of photons, r: uniform SM squeezing of input, LON_type: "localization" or "percolation", D: LON depth) and w: disorder strength

functions_S.py contains functions to evaluate entanglement, functions_U.py functions for generating the random unitaries

Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis included
